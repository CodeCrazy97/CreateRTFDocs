# CreateRTFDocs
This program makes an RTF (WordPad) version of every Word (.docx) file. I must manually copy/paste the text.

My MS subscription was soon going to expire, so I decided to create RTF documents out of all my Word documents. This program will make .rtf files out of all my .docx files, open both the .docx and .rtf versions so that I can do the copy/past manually. (Programatically copy/pasting causes the font to get messed up.) When done, the program will move the .docx versions to a backup location.
